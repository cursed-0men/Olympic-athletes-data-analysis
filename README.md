# 🏅 Athlete Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a real-world athlete dataset to understand data quality, structure, and long-term trends using core Python libraries.

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Validate data integrity by identifying **duplicate athlete names and bios**
- Analyze **temporal trends** in athlete participation across decades
- Convert raw year-level data into **meaningful decade-based aggregates**
- Communicate insights through **clear and interpretable visualizations**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

*(No black-box ML models; emphasis on fundamentals and interpretability)*

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Presence of duplicate and inconsistent records highlights the importance of data validation before analysis
- Decade-wise aggregation reveals clear shifts in athlete participation over time
- Simple statistical summaries and visualizations are effective in uncovering long-term patterns

---

## 🧠 Key Learning
Gained hands-on experience in **data quality assessment, temporal analysis, and insight-driven visualization**, reinforcing the importance of asking the right questions before applying advanced models.
